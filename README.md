# Instructions for using the database commands
## Flask PSQL
- You can use `flask psql reset` to reset the database/initalise a database onto a new docker image. 
- `flask psql test` can be used to enter a test entry with the properties:
  - name : testName
  - email : testEmail + epoch time
  - password : testPassword
  - id : generated by database
- There is also `flask psql query <NAME>` which can be used to query a name in the database. All matches will be printed to the console.
